# Yeastbound: Rise of the Dough 🍞🧀

A goofy little platformer made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) where you collect **yeast** and stomp on evil **cheese blocks**.  
Because carbs and dairy were destined to clash.

---

## Features
- **Collect Yeast** – it’s basically XP, but fluffier.  
- **Smash Cheese Enemies** – they squeak, they wobble, they crumble.  
- **Jump Around** – because what’s a platformer without a jump button?  
- **Bread-Themed Adventure** – the plot is thin, but so is sliced cheese.  

---

##  Controls
- **Arrow Keys / WASD** → Move  
- **Space** → Jump  
- **Down** → Extra squish power on cheese
